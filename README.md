## My Orchard

This is a WIP web application to manage your fruit trees in your orchard.
Once I planted my first fruit tree, I knew I want to cherish my trees, take the best care of them and to collect all the possible data I can and want to analyze.

### Planned funtionality:

- model multiple orchards, drag and drop trees into an orchard
- add data about individual trees, year planted, each year harvest, maintenance etc.
- update an orchard, remove tree, add new tree.
- get notifications when to prune, harvest etc.
- charts about each year harvest, weather etc.
- tips on how to take care of the trees
- individual trees / fruits gallery

### UI stack:

- React.js
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Chakra UI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
